Announcement for 1.2 (January 25rd, 2015)
-----------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release includes the following changes:
- methods to have truly concentric shells without distorted cells
- linear solver improvements which give up to 2x speedup in some cases
- boundary names like "top" instead of numbers are now supported in input files
- new example: free surface computation with a crust as a stagnant lid
- new benchmarks: Davies et al. and Burstedde et al.
- new initial condition: S40RTS perturbation based on shear wave data
- fixes to minimum/maximum refinement plugins
- better error messages when linear solvers fail
- many other fixes and small improvements (direct solver, file output,
  checkpointing, etc.)

A complete list of changes can be found at
  http://aspect.dealii.org/doc/doxygen/changes_between_1_81_and_1_82.html

Announcement for 1.1 (June 1st, 2014)
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.1. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release combines the incredible number of changes made during the
ASPECT hackathon in May 2014, as well as other changes made since the
last release. In particular, it includes the following changes:
- fixes to Stokes solver tolerance (users might need to change settings!)
- free surface computations
- optional direct solver support
- new material models (multi-component, simple compressible, ...)
- finer mesh refinement control using plugins
- updates to dynamic topography postprocessors
- updates to gplates boundary conditions
- compositional fields can now react with each other
- new cookbooks: reaction between fields, free surfaces
- improved PETSc support
- boundary conditions can now be time dependent 
- support for radiogenic heating models

Announcement for 1.0:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.0. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such

provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release contains a large number of changes, incorporating about one year
of work of the main authors and many contributors:
- a lot of new documentation
- new examples (2d/3d shells, GPlates, ...)
- option to remove rotational/translational modes
- big performance improvements
- compositional fields: reactions, boundary conditions
- support for periodic meshes
- output of dynamic topography
- incorporation of latent heat
- experimental PETSc support

Announcement for 0.3:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.3. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This is primarily a bug fix release. It fixes a bug in the computation of adiabatic initial temperature conditions when specifying inner or outer boundary layers (thanks to Juliane Dannberg for finding and fixing it). The doxygen-generated documentation now also automatically cross-links to deal.II classes wherever they are referenced in ASPECT.

Announcement for 0.2:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                    http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release adds a significant number of new features, including:
   - support for active and passive "compositional" fields (courtesy of
     Juliane Dannberg)
   - more flexibility to output only some variables, drastically reducing
     the amount of data written
   - support for user-defined mesh refinement criteria
   - support for GPlates-generated velocity boundary conditions (courtesy
     of Rene Gassmoeller)
   - support for passive tracer particles
   - provision of an "introspection" module as part of the source code
     to make it easier and less error-prone to write extension code
In addition, the manual has been significantly expanded, with many new
cookbooks, and we have fixed a number of bugs. A list of changes is
available here:
