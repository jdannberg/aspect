       * A class derived from DataPostprocessor that takes an output vector
       * and computes several scalar variables that represent the material
       * model outputs for every point. The list of written variables can be
       * chosen as input parameter. The principal functionality of this class
       * is already implemented in some other visualization plugins, the
       * purpose of this plugin is to efficiently compute all the wanted
       * parameters in one call to the material model.
       *
       * The member functions are all implementations of those declared in the
       * base class. See there for their meaning.
