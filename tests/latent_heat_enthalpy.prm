# This is a model setup to test the latent heat generation. 
# Material flows in from the top and crosses a phase 
# transition, where energy is released and the temperature
# increases. The energy release in this model is calculated
# from a lookup table for enthalpy values and the enthalpy
# is evaluated at the edges of each cell instead of the 
# quadrature point to catch even very sharp transitions.
# The steady-state result is around 10 % off the original 
# test, because the data table was created as small as 
# possible.
