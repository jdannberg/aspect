# This is a test for the binary loop material model. 
# It has a constant pressure and a temperature that inreases with depth, 
# so that the melt fraction shows the binary loop. However, the initial
# porosity is zero, so that melting takes place in the first time step. 
# The purpose of the test is to check that the porosity changes according 
# to the melt fraction, and both the solid and melt composition (which are
# represented by compositional fields) change according to the binary loop:
# Where material is perially molten, the melt composition should always have
# a smaller value (higher Fe content) than the solid composition, as iron
# preferentially goes into the melt.
